# Interface Controls and CPU Use

Version 0.3.0 of the threejs package uses
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/controls/TrackballControls.js
by default for smooth mouse and touch interactivity. But the package uses it in
a way that consumes some CPU cycles whenever a threejs visualization is
visible.

Alternatively, try setting the `use.orbitcontrols=TRUE` option to switch to a
variation of
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js
modified to work with the threejs package to suspend animation when there is no
plot interaction, saving CPU cycles and laptop batteries.


```{r}
suppressMessages({
library(crosstalk)
library(htmltools)
library(threejs)})

data(LeMis)
p = graphjs(LeMis, width=400)
q = graphjs(LeMis, use.orbitcontrols=TRUE, width=400)

bscols(tags$div(list(tags$h3("Default controls"), p)), tags$div(list(tags$h3("Power-saving controls"), q)))
```

The modified OrbitControls are not as responsive as the default
TrackballControls, and they limit y-axis rotation. But using
the modified OrbitControls helps the threejs package go easy
on your battery.
